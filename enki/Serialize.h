    \brief The serialization & deserialization

    For the serialization:
      - complex objects ends with OBJECT_SEPARATOR = ':'
        eg: World:Thymio:PhysicalObject:...:
      - objects of a lower complexity ends with MEMBER_SEPARATOR = '&'
        eg: Color&Point&...&
      - basic types (int, float, double, etc.) ends with TYPE_SEPARATOR = ';'
      eg: int;float;double;
*/

#define PRECISION 2 // Precision of a double (2 digits after the decimal point).

const char OBJECT_SEPARATOR = ':';
const char TYPE_SEPARATOR = ';';

    //! Return a serialization of Point

    //! Return a vector contains substring Resulting from the separation of the string by s separator
